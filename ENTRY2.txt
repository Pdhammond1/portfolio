After reading a few articles with tips on how to build a successful mentee/mentor relationship, I noticed a few common tips. All of which are easier said than done and are what I feel I need to make sure to do with my mentor. As a mentee, I find it hard to constantly ask for advice and wisdom without bringing some contribution to the relationship. Yet, if I can at least bring consistent communication, gratitude and respect to the mentor relationship then maybe I can help my mentor gain the satisfaction of supporting someone and maybe also enable my mentor to re-evaluate some of their own work practices and business decisions, and it can also possibly spark some new ideas and collaborations. I feel as the person seeking the guidance you have to initiate most of the collaboration at first and eventually the mentor hopefully can help lead you where you hope to go in the future. Every piece of advice I read highlighted the importance of communication and I feel that is the most difficult part and vital part of the relationship. Not only reaching out on a consistent basis but also trying to push the boundaries and really try to have some fruitful conversations. So, I know that would take questioning myself and truly thinking about what I want to learn from my mentor and ask them.
