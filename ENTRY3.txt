As a young Black Man in America I think about my race, socio-economic status, national origin and spiritual affiliation the most without a doubt. In the position I am in, to be going to college in California and truly have options for higher education/professional opportunities I question my identity often. I feel every decision I make, no matter the magnitude, I put my race, status, origin and spiritual beliefs into consideration and how those pieces of me will feel after I make such a decision. We all have trials and tribulations to face in life and we all make boundaries/rules in our minds to try and avoid facing unnecessary obstacles. Certain situations I may be in because of my specific identity I try to avoid for my own peace. 
        Lately I have started to notice more about myself and be more open with myself about what I do wrong and right and try to hold myself accountable. But, I also feel like I do not know my complete identity yet, so I try to just keep an open mind. I need to learn more about my spiritual beliefs and learn to lean on more important aspects of my life and identity and look at life from a glass half full perspective more often.
